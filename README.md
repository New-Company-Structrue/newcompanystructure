# New Company Structure (新型公司结构)
  
  众所周知，第一次工业革命诞生了一个组织，工厂。第二次工业革命诞生了另一个新的组织，公司。然而随着时代和经济的发展，现有的公司模式已经变得落后而陈旧。它已经越来越不适应现在的人类社会结构了。  
  
  As we all know, the first industrial revolution gave birth to an organization, a factory. The second industrial revolution gave birth to another new organization, the company. However, with the development of the times and economy, the existing company model has become backward and obsolete. It has become more and more unsuitable for the current structure of human society. 
  
  凡是去公司上班工作过的人，都知道现在公司存在的问题，公司的决策，几乎完全取决于公司高层领导甚至是老板们的个人主观意愿，当他们做出正确的决定时，公司能够顺利发展，然而当领导做出了错误的决定，公司可能面临倒闭的境地，员工就会立马失去他们赖以生存的工作。这一切的权力与底层普通员工完全没有任何关系，他们的命运完全掌握在上层的人手里。 
  
  Anyone who has ever worked in the company knows the existing problems of the company. The decision-making of the company almost depends on the personal subjective will of the company's senior leaders or even the bosses. When they make the right decision, the company can develop smoothly. However, when the leaders make the wrong decision, the company may face bankruptcy, and the employees will lose them immediately The work on which to live. The power of all this has nothing to do with the ordinary employees at the bottom. Their fate is entirely in the hands of those at the top.   
  
  这些员工可能等着发薪水，给刚出生才一星期的孩子买奶粉。或许等着还下个月的房贷或者车贷，也有准备买漂亮的新衣服，或者准备给女朋友送一个生日礼物。然而邮箱里收到被解雇的邮件时候，一切美好的愿望都破灭了。
  
  These employees may be waiting to be paid to buy milk powder for a child just a week old. Maybe waiting for next month's mortgage or car loan, or buying beautiful new clothes, or sending a birthday present to your girlfriend. However, when I received the dismissed email in my mailbox, all my good wishes were shattered.
  
  当您处在一些民主文明国家，法律会最好的保护您的权益不被公司侵犯，有完整的司法体系，强大的公会体制来维护您的权益。然而全世界并不是每个人都能幸运的生活在诸如美国，欧洲，加拿大等之类的法制国家，还是有非常多的人生活在法制并不健全的国度，这些国家的法律不健全，或者法律仅仅只停留在文字上。这些国家没有工会，或者工会形同虚构，甚至成为统治者掌控劳动者的工具。这是一个非常悲惨的局面。
  
  When you are in some democratic and civilized countries, the law will best protect your rights and interests from being infringed by the company. There is a complete judicial system and a strong guild system to protect your rights and interests. However, not everyone in the world is lucky to live in legal countries such as the United States, Europe, Canada and so on. There are still a lot of people living in countries where the legal system is not sound. The laws of these countries are not sound, or the laws only stay in words. There are no trade unions in these countries, or trade unions are fictitious, or even become tools for rulers to control workers. This is a very tragic situation.
  
  在这些法制不健全的国家里，企业主或者企业的领导们几乎可以随意废弃劳动合同（这在欧美民主国家几乎是无法想象的事情），当你对这些老板提出抗议，去法院上诉他们的时候，老板们会摆出一副无所谓的态度，他会想，随便你去上诉吧，我顶多没有支付你一两个月的薪水，然而你去上诉需要请律师，开庭审理，这需要非常多的钱和时间，远比我欠你的薪水多得多。很多员工再三选择之下，最终忍气吞声离开。
  
  In these countries with imperfect legal system, business owners or business leaders can almost abandon labor contracts at will (which is almost unimaginable in European and American democracies). When you protest against these bosses and appeal to the court, the bosses will show a indifferent attitude, he will think, appeal as you please, I haven't paid you at most Two months' salary, but you need a lawyer and a court to appeal. It takes a lot of money and time, far more than the salary I owe you. Many employees choose again and again, and finally bear to leave.
  
  在通常状况下，企业辞退员工会给员工一大笔补偿，然而在一些国家的法律里却存在这么一种情况，当员工主动申请离职，公司无需做出任何补偿。这样就留给公司一个欺负压榨员工的漏洞。当公司想辞退某位员工时候，公司领导往往会采取非常卑鄙无耻的行为，比如找出各种理由给某个员工增加工作强度，在会议上点名批评这位员工，暗中指使其他员工不配合这位员工的工作，导致他工作效率低下，等诸如此类的行为。
  
  Under normal circumstances, the company will give a large amount of compensation to employees when they are dismissed. However, in some countries, there is such a situation in the law. When employees voluntarily apply for resignation, the company does not need to make any compensation. This leaves a loophole for the company to bully and squeeze its employees. When the company wants to dismiss an employee, the company's leaders often take very despicable behaviors, such as finding out various reasons to increase the work intensity of an employee, naming and criticizing the employee at the meeting, secretly directing other employees not to cooperate with the employee's work, leading to his low work efficiency, and so on.
  
  这一切的做法都是公司领导刻意安排的，目的就是逼迫这位员工主动离职，从而公司不用支付任何赔偿。
  
  All these measures are deliberately arranged by the company's leaders to force the employee to leave voluntarily, so that the company does not have to pay any compensation.
  
  非常多的创业老板们，他们成立公司那一刻，许诺给每一位员工将来分配股份。用非常高额的回报诱惑员工去他那里工作。然而当这家公司发展壮大后，就用一切卑鄙的手段剔除曾经的创业员工。他们可以采用做假账的方法制造出公司不盈利或者盈利很少的局面（然而这些老板和管理者甚至都已经买了别墅和游艇），导致创业员工只得到非常少的回报，这在一些法制不健全的国家尤为明显。
  
  A lot of entrepreneurs promise to distribute shares to every employee in the future when they set up the company. Entice employees to work for him with very high returns. However, when the company grew, it used all mean means to eliminate its former employees. They can use the method of making fake accounts to create a situation in which the company is not profitable or has little profit (however, these bosses and managers have even bought villas and yachts), resulting in very little return for entrepreneurial employees, especially in some countries with imperfect legal system.
  
  在这些企业里，员工只是老板的奴仆，当你年轻能干有利用价值时候，老板对你笑脸相迎，然而当你老了，他们会立马毫不留情的赶走你，就像赶走一条看门十几年却走不动路的狗一样。
  
  In these enterprises, the employees are just the servants of the boss. When you are young, capable and valuable, the boss will greet you with a smile. However, when you are old, they will immediately and mercilessly drive you away, just like a dog who has been watching the door for more than ten years but can't move.
  
  很多公司，员工不敢与老板或者领导争论，在这些公司里，老板就是最大的独裁者，他说的话不能有任何人反驳，甚至是有一点点不同的看法。当你当众对老板或者某位高官提出不同的意见后，这些领导者会大声斥责你，甚至威逼开除你。这样的公司只会赶走有能力的员工，留下阿谀奉承，只会说甜言蜜语的无能员工。这些公司的老板和领导的行为，既伤害了正直有能力的员工，又损害了自己公司长远的发展。在这样的公司里，每个员工都不敢有创新，不敢发表自己的看法或者见解，因为他们不知道自己的想法是否和公司老板一致。这样的公司没有任何前途。
  
  In many companies, employees dare not argue with the boss or the leader. In these companies, the boss is the biggest dictator. What he said cannot be refuted by anyone, or even have a little different view. When you disagree with your boss or a senior official in public, these leaders will scold you loudly or even threaten to dismiss you. Such a company will only drive away capable employees and leave behind incompetent employees who are flattering and sweet talking. The behaviors of the bosses and leaders of these companies not only hurt the employees with integrity and ability, but also damage the long-term development of their own companies. In such a company, every employee is afraid to innovate and express their own opinions or opinions, because they don't know whether their ideas are consistent with the company's boss. Such a company has no future.
  
  现在的公司结构里面临最大的一个问题就是，缺乏公正。无法用一个公正，公平，公开的平台来处理公司事务。
  
  The biggest problem in the current company structure is the lack of justice. We can't use a fair, fair and open platform to deal with the company's affairs.
  
  设想一下，如果有这么一个平台，老板把公司的资金，用数字货币的形式，一次性注入类似于比特币这种去中心化的区块链平台里。每一位公司上班的员工，每个月都可以按照平台设定好的方式领到月薪。老板注入资金后，不能中途取回，他自己也只能按照商定好的公司利润比例，从平台拿取属于自己的那一份股份盈利。在这个平台里，每个人都是公正，公开，公平的，没有暗箱操作。公司的领导由公司每一个员工共同投票选举产生，每一个员工都按照区块链写入的数据持有公司的大小不等股份。
  
  Imagine that if there is such a platform, the boss will inject the company's funds in the form of digital currency into the decentralized blockchain platform like bitcoin. Every employee of the company can receive monthly salary according to the way set by the platform every month. After the boss injected the capital, he can't withdraw it halfway. He can only take his share of the profits from the platform according to the agreed profit proportion of the company. In this platform, everyone is fair, open, fair and there is no secret operation. The company's leaders are jointly elected by each employee of the company. Each employee holds different shares of the company according to the data written in the blockchain.
  
  公司的支出和收入以数字货币形式进入这个平台，所有数据全部透明，公开。公司辞退某一位员工，该员工在面对所有同事举行演讲（甚至可以把演讲稿内容写入区块链）以此证明自己并不应该被辞退，然后经过全体投票得出最终结果。
  
  The company's expenditure and income enter the platform in the form of digital currency, and all data are transparent and open. When the company dismisses an employee, the employee gives a speech to all colleagues (or even writes the content of the speech into the blockchain) to prove that he should not be dismissed, and then the final result is obtained by all the votes.
  
  当公司管理者做出某个决定，必须由公司全体员工共同做出决定，以此避免管理者的错误行为危害公司的健康发展，从而影响每一位员工的工作与生活安定。
  
  When the company's managers make a decision, it must be made by all the employees of the company, so as to avoid the managers' wrong behavior endangering the healthy development of the company, thus affecting the work and life stability of every employee.
  
  在平台里，每一位员工都可以发起对公司领导或者制度的投票，当某一位领导压榨员工，欺负员工，大家可以通过投票的方式，让他下台。在区块链里写入对应的投票结果，让该领导降低等级，每个月平台发送给他的数字货币月薪也相应减少。这一切操作不可人为干预，就像不能认为干预比特币交易一个道理。
  
  In the platform, every employee can vote for the company's leaders or systems. When a leader squeezes and bullies an employee, everyone can vote for him to step down. Write the corresponding voting results in the blockchain to lower the level of the leader, and the monthly salary of the digital currency sent to him by the platform every month will also be reduced accordingly.  All these operations can not be interfered by human beings, just like the reason that the bitcoin transaction cannot be interfered by human beings.
  
  当某位领导被投票选举下台后，却依然在公司里以管理者身份出现，员工就可以发起投票，对他制裁，严重的可以开除出公司，每个月平台不再给他的账户地址转入月薪。平台里也去掉他作为公司在职员工的记录，从而让他实质性的离开公司（甚至可以让门禁读取区块链数据，不给已经离职的员工开门）。
  
  When a leader is elected to step down, but still appears as a manager in the company, employees can vote, punish him, and even dismiss him from the company. The platform will not transfer his account address into monthly salary every month. The platform also removes his record as an employee of the company, so that he can leave the company substantially(or even let the access control read the blockchain data, not open the door to the employees who have already left).
  
  有些人会问，如果老板开始就不往平台里注入资金怎么办？以后所有的公司都必须用这个平台，否则员工就不会去这家公司上班，就这么简单。每个人去面试一家公司，首先查看的就是这家公司的平台号码，公司资金，股东人员，股份情况，月薪情况，员工数量，岗位情况，工作时间，全部在平台的区块链数据上写的清清楚楚。这将会造成优胜劣汰的达尔文自然淘汰情况，不敢使用平台的公司没人去面试，平台数据良好的公司会得到更优秀的员工。
  
  Some people ask, what if the boss doesn't put money into the platform at first? In the future, all companies must use this platform, otherwise employees will not go to work in this company, which is so simple. Everyone interviews a company. The first thing they check is the company's platform number, company funds, shareholders, shares, monthly salary, number of employees, positions, working hours, all clearly written on the blockchain data of the platform. This will lead to Darwin's natural elimination of the fittest. Companies that dare not use the platform have no one to interview, and companies with good platform data will get better employees.
  
  比如，当公司制定每天工作时间是8小时，每周不超过40小时的制度条例。如果公司管理层违背了这个条例，让员工加班，底下员工可以发起投票，对该领导制裁，降职，降薪等一系列手段。这也就解决了长期困扰员工的一个强制加班问题。比如在此之前中国的员工在github上发起了996ICU运动（996.icu）。
  
  For example, when the company has a system of working hours of 8 hours a day and no more than 40 hours a week. If the company's management violates this regulation and asks employees to work overtime, the employees below can vote to sanction the leader, demote him or her, and reduce his or her salary. This also solves a long-term problem of forced overtime. For example, before that, Chinese employees launched the 996 ICU campaign (996. ICU) on GitHub.
  
  每隔一段时间，平台会开始竞选公司每一级别的领导，每一位在职员工都可以报名参加竞选，每一位选手要把自己将要实现做的事情，写成具体的每一条，在自己任期内完成。任期结束后，每个员工可以针对每一条竞选项目给与投票评价打分，最终得到该领导任期的总体评分。比如某位领导竞选宣言是
  
  Every once in a while, the platform will start to run for the leadership of each level of the company. Every employee can sign up for the election. Each contestant should write every specific article about what he or she is going to do and finish it within his or her term of office. At the end of the term, each employee can give a vote evaluation score for each campaign item, and finally get the overall score of the leadership term. For example, a leader's campaign Manifesto is
  
  1、任期内每位员工月薪增加10%
  
  1. 10% increase in monthly salary per employee during tenure
  
  2、改善所有员工工作环境
  
  2. Improve the working environment of all employees
  
  3、做出一款新的有竞争力的市场产品
  
  3. Make a new competitive market product
  
  每一位员工都可以在该领导任期结束后给与打分，从0-10分打分。得分高的领导可以获得更多的奖金，或者股权，或者可以升值作为奖励。
  
  Each employee can give a score after the end of the leadership term, from 0-10. Leaders with high scores can get more bonuses, or equity, or appreciation as a reward.
  
  公司条款可以设定对于工作超过10年的员工，永久不能裁退，哪怕发起投票也无效。对于退休员工，每个月以退休金方式，平台系统定期转账货币到该员工账户地址里。
  每一位员工在未满永久聘用的时间内，只能遭遇两次辞退投票，每次间隔不小于3年，当两次都未通过后，该员工将被永久录用。
  
  The company's terms can be set that employees who have worked for more than 10 years can never be dismissed, even if they vote. For retired employees, the platform system transfers money to the employee's account address in the form of pension every month.
  Each employee can only encounter two dismission votes within the period of less than permanent employment, with an interval of no less than 3 years each time. If both times fail, the employee will be permanently employed.
  
  或许有人会问，当公司系统平台里的资金为0该怎么办，公司发不出工资了怎么办？所有员工会发起投票表决，是否解散公司，当一致通过后，公司自动解散，当没有一致通过，投反对票的人表决是否愿意通过公司现有的股份来继续工作，员工每个月将只能领取股份，而没有月薪。剩下愿意只拿公司股份的员工，将留下工作。如果公司起死回生，他们将得到丰厚的回报，当然，公司也有可能以后接着倒闭，自己没有任何报酬。高回报也意味着高风险。
  
  Perhaps some people will ask, when the company system platform of the fund for 0 how to do, the company can not pay wages how to do? All employees will vote to decide whether to dissolve the company. When it is unanimously approved, the company will be dissolved automatically. If it is not unanimously approved, those who vote against will vote whether they are willing to continue to work through the existing shares of the company. Employees will only receive shares each month, but no monthly salary. The remaining employees who are willing to take only shares of the company will stay for work. If the company comes back from the dead, they will get rich rewards. Of course, the company may go bankrupt later, without any reward. High return also means high risk.
  
  很多求职者觉得自己非常适合某个公司的岗位，但是现在落后的公司招聘机制，决定你是否被录用的只是某些个别掌握公司权力的人，比如老板，行政人员等。将来的公司，任何人都可以来面试，你只需要当着该公司所有人进行演讲，当大部分公司成员投票认可你的时候，你就自动进入公司试用期，当过了试用期后，所有员工再投票表决是否正式录用你为正式员工（如果是学校的话，可以让学生也参与表决，学生也是学校的成员）。
  
  Many job seekers feel that they are very suitable for a company's position, but now the backward recruitment mechanism of the company determines whether you are employed only by some individuals who have the power of the company, such as the boss, administrative personnel, etc. In a future company, anyone can come for an interview. You just need to make a speech in front of all the people in the company. When most of the company members vote for you, you will automatically enter the probation period of the company. After the probation period, all the employees will vote to determine whether to officially hire you as a regular employee (if it is a school, students can also participate in the voting, and students also learn to Members of the school).
  
  这种新的工作方式，就是未来区块链为人类带来的工作方式。当我们仔细观察，这种方式并没有改变现有的公司运作模式，员工还是在之前的办公室或者学校等机构工作，每个月也是拿着符合等级的薪水。然而这种模式改变的是人与人之间的连接方式。这就像Uber这款打车软件改变了出租车行业， 它并没有改变汽车本身，没有让4个轮子的车子变成5个轮子，也没有多增加一个方向盘进去，出租车还是以前的出租车，它改变的是车与人之间的联系方式。这也类似在中国所诞生的新发明，共享单车。它改变的只是人和自行车之间的关系。这种新的公司架构模式，将给全人类带来新的变化，让人类进入一个新的文明社会。
  
  This new way of working is the way blockchain will bring to human beings in the future. When we carefully observe, this way does not change the existing operation mode of the company. The employees still work in the previous offices or schools and other institutions, and each month they are paid according to the grade. However, this model changes the way people connect with each other. It's like Uber's taxi software has changed the taxi industry. It hasn't changed the car itself, changed the car with four wheels into five wheels, or added another steering wheel. The taxi is still the previous taxi, and what it has changed is the contact between the car and the person. It's also similar to the new invention in China, shared bicycle. It only changes the relationship between people and bicycles. This new mode of corporate structure will bring new changes to the whole human being and bring human beings into a new civilized society.
  
  这个新型公司结构能成功的秘诀就是，员工的工资收入不由公司老板或者领导直接发放，而是由去中心化的平台固定发放。员工是否被辞退的权利也不掌握在公司老板和高层手里，而是由每个人投票决定。并且当领导行为出现不公正，错误情况下，公司每一位员工都有制衡公司高层领导的权力，拥有反制，反击的权力。
  
  The secret to the success of this new corporate structure is that employees' salaries are not paid directly by the company's boss or leaders, but by decentralized platforms. The right of employees to be dismissed is not in the hands of the company's boss and senior management, but is decided by everyone's vote. And when the leadership behavior is unfair and wrong, every employee of the company has the power to check and balance the senior leaders of the company, and has the power to counter the system and fight back.
  
  当老板的钱投入平台那一刻，这个资金的使用权就已经不再是他的了。他只能按照平台规定的股份领取分红和盈利。哪怕是老板本人也得遵守平台规定，否则员工就可以发起惩罚投票，导致他降低盈利分红。这样就保证了相互得公平公正。
  
  When the boss's money is put into the platform, the right to use the money is no longer his. He can only receive dividends and profits according to the Shares specified by the platform. Even the boss himself has to abide by the rules of the platform, otherwise the employee can launch a punitive vote, leading him to reduce the Profit Dividend. In this way, fairness and justice are guaranteed to each other.
  
  一个公司的运作权力，绝对不能掌控在某个人或者某些少数人的手里，一旦这些人并不秉公办事，而是为了自己的利益，或者为了欺压别人，这个公司可能就面临非常危险的局面，每个员工都面临生活的不安定因素。因此，公司的运作，不能依靠个人的道德品质的高低，不能寄希望于老板或者高层领导大发善心，不要希望领导变善良，不再欺压底层员工。有这些想法的人，无异于希望狼不再吃肉，狼从此吃草，这样羊群就安全了。这都是非常荒谬，非常可笑的幻想。

  The operation power of a company can never be controlled by a certain person or a few people. Once these people do not act impartially, but for their own interests, or to bully others, the company may face a very dangerous situation. Every employee is facing the unstable factors of life. Therefore, the operation of the company can not rely on the level of personal moral quality, can not rely on the great kindness of the boss or senior leaders, don't hope that the leaders will become kind, and no longer bully the bottom employees. Those who have these ideas are like hoping that the wolf will no longer eat meat, and that the wolf will eat grass from then on, so that the sheep will be safe. This is a very absurd, very ridiculous fantasy.
  
  以后所有的工作场所，无论是公司，学校，工厂，商店，等。都不存在门槛，任何人都可以去申请工作，不再需要公司的人事专员去审核你的资质，不再需要大学本科学历的限制。只要你愿意去这家公司上班，你都可以去面试，当这个公司大多数人投票认可你，那么你就是这家公司的员工了。只要你能够认真干，就不用担心失业，因为公司不会大部分人去否定一位努力工作的同事。
  
  After all the workplaces, no matter the company, school, factory, shop, etc. There is no threshold, anyone can apply for a job, no longer need the company's personnel specialist to review your qualifications, no longer need the restrictions of undergraduate education. As long as you are willing to work in this company, you can go for an interview. When most people in this company vote for you, you are an employee of this company. As long as you can work hard, you don't have to worry about losing your job, because most people in the company don't deny a hard-working colleague.
  
  我决定把公司架构划分为几个部分，就像一艘航行在大海上的船一样。决策者决定这艘船的航行方向，任务分配者来分配具体的工作任务，执行者来执行对应的任务，瞭望者观察航向的正确与否和是否前方存在可能的危险，就犹如先知一般。
  
  I decided to divide the company structure into several parts, like a ship sailing on the sea. The decision-maker decides the ship's sailing direction, the task allocator assigns specific tasks, the executor performs corresponding tasks, and the lookout observes whether the course is correct or not and whether there is possible danger ahead, just like a prophet.
  
  严格来讲，每一位员工其实是属于去中心化的平台，而不是属于你这个公司。每一个公司可以对接进入去中心化的平台，充入资金开始运作，然后员工从平台领取薪水，为你工作。这一切和公司老板，领导没有任何关系。哪怕辞退员工，也是该公司所有员工共同决定，也和领导没有任何关系，当领导强迫所有员工投票剔除该员工，该员工可以发起投票，起诉该领导违规行为，所有员工投票过半后，该领导的薪水或者股份会受到削减惩罚。这就是反制的权力。并且反制投票是完全匿名的，投完后无法查看投票过程，只显示结果，不会遭到打击报复。
  
  Strictly speaking, every employee belongs to the decentralized platform, not to your company. Every company can connect into the decentralized platform, fill in the funds and start to operate, and then the employees can get the salary from the platform and work for you. All this has nothing to do with the boss and the leader of the company. Even dismissing an employee is a joint decision of all employees of the company, which has nothing to do with the leader. When the leader forces all employees to vote out the employee, the employee can initiate a vote to sue the leader for violations. After all employees vote more than half of the time, the salary or shares of the leader will be cut and punished. This is the power of anti system.And the anti voting is completely anonymous. After voting, you can't view the voting process, only show the results, and won't be retaliated.
  
  我们每个人试想一下，一个工作岗位需要符合对应的文凭，学历才能进入，这是多么的荒唐可笑。当一个年轻有为，自学成才的人掌握了对应的知识和能力后，却因为没有进入过大学学习，没有大学文凭，从而无法进入某个公司岗位工作。这是一个很滑稽，可笑的事情，这是多么的教条主义啊。无论如何都应该给每个人提供进入这个岗位的机会，不能用学历，证书，来限制每个人获取工作的机会。
  
  Let's imagine how ridiculous it is that a job requires a corresponding diploma to enter. When a young, promising, self-taught person has mastered the corresponding knowledge and ability, but because he has not entered the university to study, there is no college diploma, so he can not enter a company job. It's a funny thing. What dogmatism it is. In any case, everyone should be provided with the opportunity to enter the position. Education and certificates should not be used to limit everyone's access to the job.
  
  以后全世界所有的工作场所都会被打通，在去中心化的区块链平台里，不再是一个个孤立的岛屿。每个人都可以去自己想去的公司上班，不用担心不会说讨好老板的话而被辞退。不用担心得罪领导后惹麻烦，每个人都可以表达自己的观点，在自由的环境中发挥出自己的聪明才智。平台把掌握权力的狼嘴巴戴上了套子，不让乱伤害别人。权力得到了平衡，每个人都有保障。
  
  In the future, all workplaces in the world will be opened up. In the decentralized blockchain platform, it is no longer an isolated island. Everyone can go to the company they want to go to work, and don't worry about being dismissed because they won't flatter the boss. Don't worry about getting into trouble after offending the leaders. Everyone can express their opinions and exert their wisdom in a free environment. The platform puts the wolf's mouth in a sleeve, so as not to hurt others. Power is balanced and everyone is guaranteed.
  
  是应该改变金字塔型的人类社会结构了，只有在动物群体中才会存在这么原始的社会结构。一个物种个体在最顶端，权力最大，底层的个体在最底部，毫无权力。是应当改变的时候了。新型公司架构就改变了这种金字塔型的结构。决定你命运的并不是你顶部的人，而是所有人的投票表决。
  
  It's time to change the pyramidal structure of human society. Only in animal groups can such a primitive social structure exist. The individual of a species is at the top, with the greatest power. The individual of the bottom is at the bottom, without power. It's time to change. The new corporate structure changes the pyramid structure. It's not the people at the top who decide your destiny, it's the votes of everyone.
  
  很多人为什么好奇文明程度比人类高的外星人为什么不主动联系我们？你们有没有想过，外星人用什么角度来看待人类？最顶层一个国王或者总统，中间一群掌握权力的官僚，底层毫无权力的人民。这和动物群体有什么区别？猴群里一个猴王，中间几个听话的公猴，底层一帮小猴子。你为什么不去和森林中的某个猴群取得联系呢？外星人也是这么想的，人类和猴子没什么区别，只是一群拿着iphone的猴子罢了。
  
  Why do many people wonder why aliens with a higher level of civilization than humans don't actively contact us? Have you ever thought about how aliens view humans? A king or president at the top, a group of bureaucrats with power in the middle, and a people without power at the bottom. What's the difference between this and animal groups? A monkey king in the monkey group, a few obedient male monkeys in the middle, and a group of small monkeys at the bottom. Why don't you get in touch with some monkey group in the forest? That's what aliens think. Humans are no different from monkeys, just a group of monkeys with iPhones.
  
  随着社会，经济的发展，文凭，证书这种东西已经变成落后，淘汰的象征，这些东西从本质上否定了一个人自我学习改变的能力。人是不断变化的，以前不掌握的知识技能，经过学习后可能已经熟练掌握，曾经熟练的知识，技能长期不使用，很可能已经不再掌握。一个证书怎么能够证明这个人呢？必须要彻底淘汰这种落后的，标签式的定义方式。
  
  With the development of society and economy, diploma and certificate have become the symbol of backwardness and obsolescence, which essentially negates a person's ability to learn and change. People are constantly changing. They may have mastered the knowledge and skills they didn't master before after learning. They may not have mastered the knowledge and skills they used for a long time. How can a certificate prove this person? We must completely eliminate this backward and labeled way of definition.
  
  平台最伟大的一点就是，员工可以团结起来换掉领导。领导作恶，员工发起惩罚投票，把领导踢出管理层，在平台里，领导不能发布命令，接收员工工作汇报。最初投入资金的老板，在平台里也是公司的一员，作为出资人角色，担任股东。他想成为领导，也必须通过竞选实现。如果干的不好，也会被投票踢出管理层。
  
  The greatest point of the platform is that employees can unite to change their leaders. When leaders do evil, employees initiate punishment voting and kick leaders out of management. In the platform, leaders cannot issue orders and receive employees' work reports. The owner of the initial investment is also a member of the company in the platform, as a contributor and a shareholder. If he wants to be a leader, he has to run. If they don't do well, they will be voted out of management.
  
  在一些国家，拥有良好待遇，较高工资收入的公司或者政府事业单位，它们对于员工的要求是非常高的，有一些甚至达到了苛刻的程度。它们要求刚毕业的本科大学生才能进入该企业，甚至对性别有特殊的选择，有些公司甚至只招聘男性，有些公司只招聘中国汉人，而对于白种人，黑色人种，几乎都是拒绝的，虽然这些条例不会写成文字形式展现出来，因为这样可能造成种族歧视。然而当一个黑色人种去面试工作的时候，面试官虽然表面上说，你非常棒，能力很不错，然而他并不会发放录用通知的邮件到这个黑色人种的邮箱里。而这一切糟糕的局面都是因为这一两个掌握公司权力的人造成的。有一些公司表面上任何人都可以来面试职位，然而却暗中口头约定，不录用犹太人。这是非常糟糕可怕的情况，为了彻底终结这种歧视情况的存在，我设计了未来新型公司架构，让所有员工来决定是否录用某一位员工。而不是现在某一小部分掌握公司权力的人。让真正的自由，民主精神贯彻到每一个工作场所里。
  
  In some countries, companies or government institutions with good treatment and higher wage income have very high requirements for their employees, some of which even reach a harsh level. They require newly graduated undergraduate students to enter the enterprise, and even have a special choice of gender. Some companies even only recruit men, some companies only recruit Chinese Han people, while for white people, black people, almost all are rejected, although these regulations will not be written in written form, because this may cause racial discrimination. However, when a black person goes to interview for a job, the interviewer will not send the email of employment notice to the black person's mailbox, although on the surface, you are very good and capable. And it's all bad because of one or two people in charge of the company. There are some companies where, on the face of it, anyone can come to interview for a job, but they secretly make verbal agreements not to hire Jews. This is a terrible situation. In order to put an end to this discrimination, I designed a new corporate structure for all employees to decide whether to hire an employee or not. It's not a small group of people in charge of the company right now. Let real freedom and democracy be carried out in every workplace.
  
  在去求职面试的时候，每一位员工甚至都可以采用录制视频的方式，然后把该视频上传到所希望面试的公司岗位上去，让该公司每个人都来投票选择哪个人能够进入岗位。这样每个求职者可以每天面试无数家公司，会非常容易，很快的找到适合自己的工作岗位。简单快速，公司员工投票过半，你就可以直接去这个公司上班了。不必坐车跑到这家公司去填写繁琐而毫无意义的表格，冒着泄露个人隐私的风险，填写个人信息问卷，甚至做一套难度很大的专业技术试卷，遭遇不专业的面试官刁难，侮辱。这一切都不将存在。
  
  When going to the job interview, every employee can even record a video, and then upload the video to the position of the company they want to interview, so that everyone in the company can vote to choose which person can enter the position. In this way, every job seeker can interview countless companies every day. It will be very easy to find the right job quickly. It's simple and fast. After half of the company's employees vote, you can go to work directly in this company. Don't have to go to this company by car to fill in the tedious and meaningless forms, take the risk of divulging personal privacy, fill in the personal information questionnaire, even make a set of difficult professional and technical papers, encounter difficulties and insults from unprofessional interviewers. None of this will exist.
  
  新型公司结构的目的就是让公司成为员工第二个家，一个不需要看别人脸色工作的地方，你只要认真努力工作，这里就是你可以永久依靠的地方。这里没有哪个资本家老板可以随意使唤你，没有哪个你得罪了的领导可以明天就解雇你，你自己才是这个公司真正的主人。他们这些股东，老板，领导，也必须遵守平台的规则，否则就会收到员工发起的惩罚投票，从而影响收入，股份，分红。
  
  The purpose of the new company structure is to make the company a second home for employees, a place where you don't need to look at others' faces and work hard. This is where you can rely on forever. No capitalist boss here can call you at will. No leader you offend can fire you tomorrow. You are the real owner of the company. These shareholders, bosses and leaders must also abide by the rules of the platform, or they will receive punishment votes from employees, which will affect income, shares and dividends.
  
  新型公司结构使得现有的公司模式彻底改变，不再是大鱼吃小鱼，猫吃老鼠的游戏。而是在老鼠身上也装上了钢刺，权力达到了平衡。当猫以为自己很强大，可以随便吃任何老鼠的时候，它得考虑下眼前这一只弱小的，浑身是锋利钢刺的老鼠该不该吃。
  
  The new company structure has completely changed the existing company model, which is no longer a game of big fish eating small fish, cat eating mouse. Instead, the rats were equipped with steel spikes, and power was balanced. When the cat thinks that he is very strong and can eat any mouse at will, he has to consider whether the weak mouse with sharp steel spikes should be eaten.
  
  这样的结构，可以使每个人的才能和价值得到正确的发挥。每个人都可以快速找到自己感兴趣的工作。从而社会生产力会进一步大大提高。诸所周知，社会中存在很多有精神问题的人，比如一些拥有严重人格障碍的人，自恋型人格障碍，情绪不稳定型人格障碍，偏执狂等。这些人如果掌控公司权力，那么将是该公司所有员工的噩梦，稳定的工作和生活将面临岌岌可危的局面。新型公司架构，就可以采用民主投票方式，让这种人下台，丧失领导权，甚至驱离公司。
  
  Such a structure can give full play to the talents and values of everyone. Everyone can quickly find a job that interests them. Thus the social productivity will be greatly improved. As we all know, there are many people with mental problems in society, such as some people with serious personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, emotional instability personality disorder, paranoia and so on. If these people control the power of the company, it will be a nightmare for all employees of the company, and the stable work and life will face a precarious situation. The new company structure can adopt the democratic voting method to let this kind of person step down, lose the leadership, or even drive away from the company.
  
  更为先进的是，平台采用区块链比特币的技术，所有数据公开，公司人员，资金总数，现金流，员工离职率，公司人事变动情况，每个月盈利情况，公司收支情况等，都有清晰明确的数字记录。而且每个人都可以往你看好的公司资金地址充入数字货币，从而成为该公司股东，享有年底分红权力。这也就意味着，股市将消失，成为历史。
  
  What's more, the platform adopts the technology of blockchain bitcoin. All data are open, and the company's personnel, total funds, cash flow, employee turnover rate, personnel changes, monthly profits, company revenue and expenditure are recorded clearly. And everyone can add digital currency to your preferred company's capital address, so that they can become shareholders of the company and enjoy the right to dividend at the end of the year. This means that the stock market will disappear and become history.
  
  在公司里，每个人的工资薪水其实是浮动的，除了基本工资外，就是公司当年的盈利分红，每一位员工都可以从公司当年的盈利里得到分红，每一位入职的员工都持有员工股比例。在这个系统里， 没有主动开除，辞退某位员工的功能。除非他自己离开公司，而在离开的时候，要根据N+3的补偿，支付该员工赔偿（N为工作年限，未满一年则只额外补偿一个月薪水）。
  
  In the company, everyone's salary is actually floating. In addition to the basic salary, it is the Profit Dividend of the company in that year. Every employee can get the dividend from the profit of the company in that year, and every employee who enters the company holds the proportion of employee shares. In this system, there is no function of actively dismissing an employee. Unless he leaves the company by himself, and at the time of leaving, he shall pay compensation to the employee according to the compensation of N + 3 (n is the working years, and only one additional month's salary will be compensated for less than one year).
  
  这个平台甚至有快速组建公司的能力，每个人都可以组建公司，在自己公司的环境里，可以联系你有共同理想，共同理念的人，发起组建一个新公司，当公司里的人过半投票赞同，那么你的公司就成立了。这就好比从一个树枝上分化出另一个枝干，可以得到母公司的资金支持，孵化出新的公司。这样这家公司就保持了旺盛的生命力，一旦原有的公司产品被淘汰，员工可以投票调入新孵化出来的，有前景的公司里去工作，而不用担心失业。这样的话，公司就成为一个有活力的有机生命体。可以随时长出新的，有生命力的东西出来，淘汰掉旧的东西。永远保持青春和活力。孵化出来的枝干公司，需要的资金不能超过自己上一级母公司资金的2%，否则新公司会把母公司拖累死。树枝哪怕发芽，也只会先发小芽出来。然后小芽慢慢长大成为枝干。如果公司里的人都不赞同，那么你还可以独立成立公司，吸引社会上的风投资金帮助你成立公司。这就好比种子落地，彻底脱离母体而发育。总体来讲，树枝发芽的成活率比种子成活率要高很多。
  
  This platform even has the ability to set up a company quickly. Everyone can set up a company. In their own company environment, you can contact people with common ideals and ideas to start a new company. When more than half of the people in the company vote for approval, your company will be set up. It's like separating one branch from another, which can be funded by the parent company and incubate new companies. In this way, the company will maintain a strong vitality. Once the original company's products are eliminated, employees can vote to transfer into the newly hatched and promising companies to work without worrying about unemployment. In this way, the company will become a dynamic organic life. We can grow new and vigorous things at any time and eliminate the old ones. Always be young and energetic. The funds needed by the branch companies incubated should not exceed 2% of the funds of their parent companies, otherwise the new companies will drag the parent companies to death. Even if a branch sprouts, it will only sprout first. Then the buds grow into branches. If people in the company don't agree, you can also set up a company independently to attract social venture capital to help you set up a company. It's like a seed landing and developing completely out of its mother's body. Generally speaking, the survival rate of branch germination is much higher than that of seed.
  
  可能世界上很多人不知道，在中国有两种工作体制，一种是私营企业，一种是国有政府事业。这两者的区别是，私营企业收入高，工作效率高，但是容易被裁撤，制度不完善，企业经常压榨，虐待员工，而国有企业待遇相对低一些，工作效率较低，但是各种福利待遇高，免费住房，免费吃饭，免费医疗等，企业关心员工，不存在裁员。我想做的就是把二者的优点结合起来，创造出新的公司模式。一个劳动者真正能够自我做主的，有创造力的，关怀员工的工作组织模式。
  
  Maybe many people in the world don't know that there are two working systems in China, one is private enterprises, the other is state-owned government. The difference between the two is that the private enterprise has high income and high working efficiency, but it is easy to be eliminated, the system is not perfect, the enterprise often squeezes and abuses employees, while the state-owned enterprise has relatively low treatment and low working efficiency, but all kinds of welfare treatment are high, free housing, free meals, free medical treatment, etc., the enterprise cares about employees, and there is no layoff. What I want to do is to combine the advantages of the two and create a new company model. A work organization mode that a worker can really be self-determined, creative and caring for employees.
  
  每个员工都可以民主的发起投票，在公司的框架下，创立任何部门，任何组织，任何你可能现在都想不到的事情和组织，只要这个公司里的人投票过半就通过。比如成立一个非盈利的舞蹈表演部门，专门负责节日活动准备，演出等。
  
  Every employee can vote democratically. Within the framework of the company, create any department, any organization, any thing or organization that you may not think of now, as long as more than half of the people in the company vote. For example, set up a non-profit dance performance department, which is responsible for festival preparation and performance.
  
  从母公司分化出来的部门或者公司，需要的资金甚至可以由每个员工选择，每个人基于公司现在的资金，给出一个小于它的数字，然后根据一系列的算法，得出一个最合理的数字。
  
  For the departments or companies separated from the parent company, the funds needed can even be selected by each employee. Each employee can give a number smaller than the company's current funds, and then get the most reasonable number according to a series of algorithms.
  
  一个公司只有在最稳定，最无可争议的平台系统下运作，公司才能有稳定的组成。否则就会变成封建王朝内部互相的权力争夺，上演一幕幕现代版的宫廷政变。最近比较有名的是中国一家在美国的上市公司，当当网（www.dangdang.com），公司之前的创始人李国庆带领5人闯进公司办公室，抢走了公司几十枚公司办公章。而更搞笑的是，现在公司的实际掌控人是他已经离婚的老婆。一场夫妻财富抢夺大战，成为影响几百人的事情。多么的荒谬可笑。这些人小丑一般的行为，让更多人的工作和生活陷入了不安定的环境中。这是一种多么糟糕的局面啊。
  
  Only when a company operates under the most stable and indisputable platform system can a company have a stable composition. Otherwise, it will become the power struggle within the feudal dynasty and stage a modern version of the palace coup. Recently, Dangdang (www.dangdang. Com), a Chinese listed company in the United States, was more famous. Li Guoqing, the former founder of the company, led five people into the company's office and robbed dozens of official seals of the company. What's more funny is that the actual controller of the company is his divorced wife. A battle for husband and wife's wealth has become a matter affecting hundreds of people. How ridiculous. These people clown like behavior, so that more people's work and life into an unstable environment. What a terrible situation it is.
