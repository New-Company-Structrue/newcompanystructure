# New Company Structure (新型公司结构)

#English:  
  As we all know, the first industrial revolution gave birth to an organization, a factory. The second industrial revolution gave birth to another new organization, the company. However, with the development of the times and economy, the existing company model has become backward and obsolete. It has become more and more unsuitable for the current structure of human society.  
  
  Anyone who has ever worked in the company knows the existing problems of the company. The decision-making of the company almost depends on the personal subjective will of the company's senior leaders or even the bosses. When they make the right decision, the company can develop smoothly. However, when the leaders make the wrong decision, the company may face bankruptcy, and the employees will lose them immediately The work on which to live. The power of all this has nothing to do with the ordinary employees at the bottom. Their fate is entirely in the hands of those at the top.  
  
  These employees may be waiting to be paid to buy milk powder for a child just a week old. Maybe waiting for next month's mortgage or car loan, or buying beautiful new clothes, or sending a birthday present to your girlfriend. However, when I received the dismissed email in my mailbox, all my good wishes were shattered.
  
  When you are in some democratic and civilized countries, the law will best protect your rights and interests from being infringed by the company. There is a complete judicial system and a strong guild system to protect your rights and interests. However, not everyone in the world is lucky to live in legal countries such as the United States, Europe, Canada and so on. There are still a lot of people living in countries where the legal system is not sound. The laws of these countries are not sound, or the laws only stay in words. There are no trade unions in these countries, or trade unions are fictitious, or even become tools for rulers to control workers. This is a very tragic situation.
  
In these countries with imperfect legal system, business owners or business leaders can almost abandon labor contracts at will (which is almost unimaginable in European and American democracies). When you protest against these bosses and appeal to the court, the bosses will show a indifferent attitude, he will think, appeal as you please, I haven't paid you at most Two months' salary, but you need a lawyer and a court to appeal. It takes a lot of money and time, far more than the salary I owe you. Many employees choose again and again, and finally bear to leave.
  
  Under normal circumstances, the company will give a large amount of compensation to employees when they are dismissed. However, in some countries, there is such a situation in the law. When employees voluntarily apply for resignation, the company does not need to make any compensation. This leaves a loophole for the company to bully and squeeze its employees. When the company wants to dismiss an employee, the company's leaders often take very despicable behaviors, such as finding out various reasons to increase the work intensity of an employee, naming and criticizing the employee at the meeting, secretly directing other employees not to cooperate with the employee's work, leading to his low work efficiency, and so on.

  众所周知，第一次工业革命诞生了一个组织，工厂。第二次工业革命诞生了另一个新的组织，公司。然而随着时代和经济的发展，现有的公司模式已经变得落后而陈旧。它已经越来越不适应现在的人类社会结构了。  
  
  凡是去公司上班工作过的人，都知道现在公司存在的问题，公司的决策，几乎完全取决于公司高层领导甚至是老板们的个人主观意愿，当他们做出正确的决定时，公司能够顺利发展，然而当领导做出了错误的决定，公司可能面临倒闭的境地，员工就会立马失去他们赖以生存的工作。这一切的权力与底层普通员工完全没有任何关系，他们的命运完全掌握在上层的人手里。  
  
  这些员工可能等着发薪水，给刚出生才一星期的孩子买奶粉。或许等着还下个月的房贷或者车贷，也有准备买漂亮的新衣服，或者准备给女朋友送一个生日礼物。然而邮箱里收到被解雇的邮件时候，一切美好的愿望都破灭了。
  
  当您处在一些民主文明国家，法律会最好的保护您的权益不被公司侵犯，有完整的司法体系，强大的公会体制来维护您的权益。然而全世界并不是每个人都能幸运的生活在诸如美国，欧洲，加拿大等之类的法制国家，还是有非常多的人生活在法制并不健全的国度，这些国家的法律不健全，或者法律仅仅只停留在文字上。这些国家没有工会，或者工会形同虚构，甚至成为统治者掌控劳动者的工具。这是一个非常悲惨的局面。
  
在这些法制不健全的国家里，企业主或者企业的领导们几乎可以随意废弃劳动合同（这在欧美民主国家几乎是无法想象的事情），当你对这些老板提出抗议，去法院上诉他们的时候，老板们会摆出一副无所谓的态度，他会想，随便你去上诉吧，我顶多没有支付你一两个月的薪水，然而你去上诉需要请律师，开庭审理，这需要非常多的钱和时间，远比我欠你的薪水多得多。很多员工再三选择之下，最终忍气吞声离开。
  
  在通常状况下，企业辞退员工会给员工一大笔补偿，然而在一些国家的法律里却存在这么一种情况，当员工主动申请离职，公司无需做出任何补偿。这样就留给公司一个欺负压榨员工的漏洞。当公司想辞退某位员工时候，公司领导往往会采取非常卑鄙无耻的行为，比如找出各种理由给某个员工增加工作强度，在会议上点名批评这位员工，暗中指使其他员工不配合这位员工的工作，导致他工作效率低下，等诸如此类的行为。
