# newcompanystructure (新型公司结构)

#English:
As we all know, the first industrial revolution gave birth to an organization, a factory. The second industrial revolution gave birth to another new organization, the company. However, with the development of the times and economy, the existing company model has become backward and obsolete.
Anyone who has ever worked in the company knows the existing problems of the company. The decision-making of the company almost depends on the personal subjective will of the company's senior leaders or even the bosses. When they make the right decision, the company can develop smoothly. However, when the leaders make the wrong decision, the company may face bankruptcy, and the employees will lose them immediately The work on which to live. The power of all this has nothing to do with the ordinary employees at the bottom. Their fate is entirely in the hands of those at the top.

众所周知，第一次工业革命诞生了一个组织，工厂。第二次工业革命诞生了另一个新的组织，公司。然而随着时代和经济的发展，现有的公司模式已经变得落后而陈旧。
凡是去公司上班工作过的人，都知道现在公司存在的问题，公司的决策，几乎完全取决于公司高层领导甚至是老板们的个人主观意愿，当他们做出正确的决定时，公司能够顺利发展，然而当领导做出了错误的决定，公司可能面临倒闭的境地，员工就会立马失去他们赖以生存的工作。这一切的权力与底层普通员工完全没有任何关系，他们的命运完全掌握在上层的人手里。
