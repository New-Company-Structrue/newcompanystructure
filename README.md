# New Company Structure (新型公司结构)

#English:  
  As we all know, the first industrial revolution gave birth to an organization, a factory. The second industrial revolution gave birth to another new organization, the company. However, with the development of the times and economy, the existing company model has become backward and obsolete. It has become more and more unsuitable for the current structure of human society.  
  
  Anyone who has ever worked in the company knows the existing problems of the company. The decision-making of the company almost depends on the personal subjective will of the company's senior leaders or even the bosses. When they make the right decision, the company can develop smoothly. However, when the leaders make the wrong decision, the company may face bankruptcy, and the employees will lose them immediately The work on which to live. The power of all this has nothing to do with the ordinary employees at the bottom. Their fate is entirely in the hands of those at the top.  
  
  These employees may be waiting to be paid to buy milk powder for a child just a week old. Maybe waiting for next month's mortgage or car loan, or buying beautiful new clothes, or sending a birthday present to your girlfriend. However, when I received the dismissed email in my mailbox, all my good wishes were shattered.
  
  When you are in some democratic and civilized countries, the law will best protect your rights and interests from being infringed by the company. There is a complete judicial system and a strong guild system to protect your rights and interests. However, not everyone in the world is lucky to live in legal countries such as the United States, Europe, Canada and so on. There are still a lot of people living in countries where the legal system is not sound. The laws of these countries are not sound, or the laws only stay in words. There are no trade unions in these countries, or trade unions are fictitious, or even become tools for rulers to control workers. This is a very tragic situation.
  
In these countries with imperfect legal system, business owners or business leaders can almost abandon labor contracts at will (which is almost unimaginable in European and American democracies). When you protest against these bosses and appeal to the court, the bosses will show a indifferent attitude, he will think, appeal as you please, I haven't paid you at most Two months' salary, but you need a lawyer and a court to appeal. It takes a lot of money and time, far more than the salary I owe you. Many employees choose again and again, and finally bear to leave.
  
  Under normal circumstances, the company will give a large amount of compensation to employees when they are dismissed. However, in some countries, there is such a situation in the law. When employees voluntarily apply for resignation, the company does not need to make any compensation. This leaves a loophole for the company to bully and squeeze its employees. When the company wants to dismiss an employee, the company's leaders often take very despicable behaviors, such as finding out various reasons to increase the work intensity of an employee, naming and criticizing the employee at the meeting, secretly directing other employees not to cooperate with the employee's work, leading to his low work efficiency, and so on.

  All these measures are deliberately arranged by the company's leaders to force the employee to leave voluntarily, so that the company does not have to pay any compensation.
  
  A lot of entrepreneurs promise to distribute shares to every employee in the future when they set up the company. Entice employees to work for him with very high returns. However, when the company grew, it used all mean means to eliminate its former employees. They can use the method of making fake accounts to create a situation in which the company is not profitable or has little profit (however, these bosses and managers have even bought villas and yachts), resulting in very little return for entrepreneurial employees, especially in some countries with imperfect legal system.
  
  In these enterprises, the employees are just the servants of the boss. When you are young, capable and valuable, the boss will greet you with a smile. However, when you are old, they will immediately and mercilessly drive you away, just like a dog who has been watching the door for more than ten years but can't move.
  
  In many companies, employees dare not argue with the boss or the leader. In these companies, the boss is the biggest dictator. What he said cannot be refuted by anyone, or even have a little different view. When you disagree with your boss or a senior official in public, these leaders will scold you loudly or even threaten to dismiss you. Such a company will only drive away capable employees and leave behind incompetent employees who are flattering and sweet talking. The behaviors of the bosses and leaders of these companies not only hurt the employees with integrity and ability, but also damage the long-term development of their own companies. In such a company, every employee is afraid to innovate and express their own opinions or opinions, because they don't know whether their ideas are consistent with the company's boss. Such a company has no future.
  
  The biggest problem in the current company structure is the lack of justice. We can't use a fair, fair and open platform to deal with the company's affairs.
  
  Imagine that if there is such a platform, the boss will inject the company's funds in the form of digital currency into the decentralized blockchain platform like bitcoin. Every employee of the company can receive monthly salary according to the way set by the platform every month. After the boss injected the capital, he can't withdraw it halfway. He can only take his share of the profits from the platform according to the agreed profit proportion of the company. In this platform, everyone is fair, open, fair and there is no secret operation. The company's leaders are jointly elected by each employee of the company. Each employee holds different shares of the company according to the data written in the blockchain.
  
  The company's expenditure and income enter the platform in the form of digital currency, and all data are transparent and open. When the company dismisses an employee, the employee gives a speech to all colleagues (or even writes the content of the speech into the blockchain) to prove that he should not be dismissed, and then the final result is obtained by all the votes.

  When the company's managers make a decision, it must be made by all the employees of the company, so as to avoid the managers' wrong behavior endangering the healthy development of the company, thus affecting the work and life stability of every employee.
  
  In the platform, every employee can vote for the company's leaders or systems. When a leader squeezes and bullies an employee, everyone can vote for him to step down. Write the corresponding voting results in the blockchain to lower the level of the leader, and the monthly salary of the digital currency sent to him by the platform every month will also be reduced accordingly.  All these operations can not be interfered by human beings, just like the reason that the bitcoin transaction cannot be interfered by human beings.
  
  When a leader is elected to step down, but still appears as a manager in the company, employees can vote, punish him, and even dismiss him from the company. The platform will not transfer his account address into monthly salary every month. The platform also removes his record as an employee of the company, so that he can leave the company substantially(or even let the access control read the blockchain data, not open the door to the employees who have already left).
  
  Some people ask, what if the boss doesn't put money into the platform at first? In the future, all companies must use this platform, otherwise employees will not go to work in this company, which is so simple. Everyone interviews a company. The first thing they check is the company's platform number, company funds, shareholders, shares, monthly salary, number of employees, positions, working hours, all clearly written on the blockchain data of the platform. This will lead to Darwin's natural elimination of the fittest. Companies that dare not use the platform have no one to interview, and companies with good platform data will get better employees.
  
  For example, when the company has a system of working hours of 8 hours a day and no more than 40 hours a week. If the company's management violates this regulation and asks employees to work overtime, the employees below can vote to sanction the leader, demote him or her, and reduce his or her salary. This also solves a long-term problem of forced overtime. For example, before that, Chinese employees launched the 996 ICU campaign (996. ICU) on GitHub.

  众所周知，第一次工业革命诞生了一个组织，工厂。第二次工业革命诞生了另一个新的组织，公司。然而随着时代和经济的发展，现有的公司模式已经变得落后而陈旧。它已经越来越不适应现在的人类社会结构了。  
  
  凡是去公司上班工作过的人，都知道现在公司存在的问题，公司的决策，几乎完全取决于公司高层领导甚至是老板们的个人主观意愿，当他们做出正确的决定时，公司能够顺利发展，然而当领导做出了错误的决定，公司可能面临倒闭的境地，员工就会立马失去他们赖以生存的工作。这一切的权力与底层普通员工完全没有任何关系，他们的命运完全掌握在上层的人手里。  
  
  这些员工可能等着发薪水，给刚出生才一星期的孩子买奶粉。或许等着还下个月的房贷或者车贷，也有准备买漂亮的新衣服，或者准备给女朋友送一个生日礼物。然而邮箱里收到被解雇的邮件时候，一切美好的愿望都破灭了。
  
  当您处在一些民主文明国家，法律会最好的保护您的权益不被公司侵犯，有完整的司法体系，强大的公会体制来维护您的权益。然而全世界并不是每个人都能幸运的生活在诸如美国，欧洲，加拿大等之类的法制国家，还是有非常多的人生活在法制并不健全的国度，这些国家的法律不健全，或者法律仅仅只停留在文字上。这些国家没有工会，或者工会形同虚构，甚至成为统治者掌控劳动者的工具。这是一个非常悲惨的局面。
  
在这些法制不健全的国家里，企业主或者企业的领导们几乎可以随意废弃劳动合同（这在欧美民主国家几乎是无法想象的事情），当你对这些老板提出抗议，去法院上诉他们的时候，老板们会摆出一副无所谓的态度，他会想，随便你去上诉吧，我顶多没有支付你一两个月的薪水，然而你去上诉需要请律师，开庭审理，这需要非常多的钱和时间，远比我欠你的薪水多得多。很多员工再三选择之下，最终忍气吞声离开。
  
  在通常状况下，企业辞退员工会给员工一大笔补偿，然而在一些国家的法律里却存在这么一种情况，当员工主动申请离职，公司无需做出任何补偿。这样就留给公司一个欺负压榨员工的漏洞。当公司想辞退某位员工时候，公司领导往往会采取非常卑鄙无耻的行为，比如找出各种理由给某个员工增加工作强度，在会议上点名批评这位员工，暗中指使其他员工不配合这位员工的工作，导致他工作效率低下，等诸如此类的行为。
  
  这一切的做法都是公司领导刻意安排的，目的就是逼迫这位员工主动离职，从而公司不用支付任何赔偿。
  
  非常多的创业老板们，他们成立公司那一刻，许诺给每一位员工将来分配股份。用非常高额的回报诱惑员工去他那里工作。然而当这家公司发展壮大后，就用一切卑鄙的手段剔除曾经的创业员工。他们可以采用做假账的方法制造出公司不盈利或者盈利很少的局面（然而这些老板和管理者甚至都已经买了别墅和游艇），导致创业员工只得到非常少的回报，这在一些法制不健全的国家尤为明显。
  
  在这些企业里，员工只是老板的奴仆，当你年轻能干有利用价值时候，老板对你笑脸相迎，然而当你老了，他们会立马毫不留情的赶走你，就像赶走一条看门十几年却走不动路的狗一样。

  很多公司，员工不敢与老板或者领导争论，在这些公司里，老板就是最大的独裁者，他说的话不能有任何人反驳，甚至是有一点点不同的看法。当你当众对老板或者某位高官提出不同的意见后，这些领导者会大声斥责你，甚至威逼开除你。这样的公司只会赶走有能力的员工，留下阿谀奉承，只会说甜言蜜语的无能员工。这些公司的老板和领导的行为，既伤害了正直有能力的员工，又损害了自己公司长远的发展。在这样的公司里，每个员工都不敢有创新，不敢发表自己的看法或者见解，因为他们不知道自己的想法是否和公司老板一致。这样的公司没有任何前途。
  
  现在的公司结构里面临最大的一个问题就是，缺乏公正。无法用一个公正，公平，公开的平台来处理公司事务。
  
  设想一下，如果有这么一个平台，老板把公司的资金，用数字货币的形式，一次性注入类似于比特币这种去中心化的区块链平台里。每一位公司上班的员工，每个月都可以按照平台设定好的方式领到月薪。老板注入资金后，不能中途取回，他自己也只能按照商定好的公司利润比例，从平台拿取属于自己的那一份股份盈利。在这个平台里，每个人都是公正，公开，公平的，没有暗箱操作。公司的领导由公司每一个员工共同投票选举产生，每一个员工都按照区块链写入的数据持有公司的大小不等股份。
  
  公司的支出和收入以数字货币形式进入这个平台，所有数据全部透明，公开。公司辞退某一位员工，该员工在面对所有同事举行演讲（甚至可以把演讲稿内容写入区块链）以此证明自己并不应该被辞退，然后经过全体投票得出最终结果。

  当公司管理者做出某个决定，必须由公司全体员工共同做出决定，以此避免管理者的错误行为危害公司的健康发展，从而影响每一位员工的工作与生活安定。

  在平台里，每一位员工都可以发起对公司领导或者制度的投票，当某一位领导压榨员工，欺负员工，大家可以通过投票的方式，让他下台。在区块链里写入对应的投票结果，让该领导降低等级，每个月平台发送给他的数字货币月薪也相应减少。这一切操作不可人为干预，就像不能认为干预比特币交易一个道理。

  当某位领导被投票选举下台后，却依然在公司里以管理者身份出现，员工就可以发起投票，对他制裁，严重的可以开除出公司，每个月平台不再给他的账户地址转入月薪。平台里也去掉他作为公司在职员工的记录，从而让他实质性的离开公司（甚至可以让门禁读取区块链数据，不给已经离职的员工开门）。
  
  有些人会问，如果老板开始就不往平台里注入资金怎么办？以后所有的公司都必须用这个平台，否则员工就不会去这家公司上班，就这么简单。每个人去面试一家公司，首先查看的就是这家公司的平台号码，公司资金，股东人员，股份情况，月薪情况，员工数量，岗位情况，工作时间，全部在平台的区块链数据上写的清清楚楚。这将会造成优胜劣汰的达尔文自然淘汰情况，不敢使用平台的公司没人去面试，平台数据良好的公司会得到更优秀的员工。
  
  比如，当公司制定每天工作时间是8小时，每周不超过40小时的制度条例。如果公司管理层违背了这个条例，让员工加班，底下员工可以发起投票，对该领导制裁，降职，降薪等一系列手段。这也就解决了长期困扰员工的一个强制加班问题。比如在此之前中国的员工在github上发起了996ICU运动（996.icu）。
